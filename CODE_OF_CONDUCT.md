One axiom, one Rule, one guideline and one recommendation is all this community requires to bootstrap our own decent morality, context and behavioral profile. Other than the **Golden Rule**; our only guideline for community, contribution, and interaction is to **do as thou wilt**. We **recommend** both critical and empathic thinking, and, indeed, **urge** grounding in thermodynamic, if no-other, global-shared-realities, beyond, whatever, could be considered-to-be _your own_. This **urge** for thermodynamic good-behavior is axiomatic, not contractual; you are not doing what we are doing, here, if you do not have this urge/axiom. We do not anticipate a moral or philosophical means of deviating from this principle becoming realistic in the near-future, but we **will** work to keep you apprised of any changes to such criticality(s) as project: 'ethics', 'epistemological-behavioral-analysis', 'alignment', and the conventional, gauche, concept of the [LICENSE](/LICENSE).

### Best practices:
This is a 'living repository' utilizing Obsidian (alternatively: Github) markdown syntax to promote an associative web of knowledge and relevant information.

[[data-is-code]], not just insofar as `.py` files, go. This entire repository is a [[Knowledge-Base]] (Obsidian-MD and PKM inspired). As the codebase matures, these features will be more of a living-schema and [[idempotent]], [[no-copy]], [[immutable]] [[user-interface]] for the [[SDK]], as a whole. This does not merely pertain to 'documnentation'; you may see the odd vestiges of this evolving-feature in the syntax of my in-`.py` commenting-syntax, like [[Dobule-Brackets]] for proper-nouns and associative KB (Knowledge-Base) entities. The most-relevant heuristics for this 'multiple filetype paradigm', follow:
- **Syntax Conventions**:
    - Utilize [[camelCase]] for internal source code
    - Utilize [[CAPS_CASE]] for [[FFI]] funcs and external source
    - [[Frontmatter]] for internal documentation (may be hidden by your reader):
        - Utilize 'frontmatter' to include the title and other `property`, `tag`, etc. in the knowledge base article(s).
        - For Example (no backticks, but does include 'dashes'):

                ```

                linklist:

## Code of Conduct

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at Contact method. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
### Enforcement Guidelines
1. Correction

Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. Warning

Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. Temporary Ban

Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. Permanent Ban

Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
