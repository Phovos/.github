This SDK implements Morphological Source Code exhibiting Quineic Statistical Dynamics (QSD), a computational framework where:
- **ByteWords** are atomic morphogens (8-bit quantum observables)
- **Metrics** are hidden variables (transcendental, non-observable from inside)
- **WindingPairs** encode non-Markovian state (holonomic memory)
- **T-strings** (Python 3.14) enforce hermitian type constraints at the boundary

The result: A system where **computation is measurement**, **types are boundary conditions**, and **the morphological clock emerges from thermodynamic cost**.

**Time, causality, and identity emerge from morphology and, specifically, not the other way around.** A multi-scale ontogeny must do-so in [[Hermitian Conjugation]] syntax. This very requirement also gives rise to the [[Fermionic]] half-integer spin and it's symmetry group. It is thereby extended into the local domain using 'correspondence' about a 'boundary'; a type of symmetry that is something like mirror-symmetry, implying an observer and a two way speed of light, if nothing else. The spinor - Dual-Valued Representation in Holographic Runtime Systems (Classically Non-Determinable 2-Valuedness in Phase Space Topology) is the substrate of said aformentioned **time**, and importantly; entropy and ergodic, intensive character:

> In a dual-representational phase/state space—trivially a Hilbert Space, the AdS/CFT correspondence manifests as the 'special conformal twist' operator: the 'spinor' in boundary-bulk correspondence.
